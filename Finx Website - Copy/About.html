          The International Socioeconomics Laboratory™ (ISL) is a global research network of primarily students and young adults that strive to find the most adequate solutions to current socio-economic problems and those that may be just around the corner. We make use of existing records and data to create our own comprehensive models and studies to find plausible routes to the root cause of these problems and see what can be done about them or what knowledge can be acquired. However, our information collection is not limited to what is already in sight; though it may be more difficult given the unprecedented times, we also look to collect information and data through surveys and soon, types of experiments as well. The goal of the ISL is clear; assess and address the issues that face our society through the will and capability of the youth in order to foster a greater one.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraph">
          The work done in the ISL serves as the foundation for the work done by its sister organizations Finxspire and Finxerunt. We plan on having our research be used by Finxspire to create real political policy that will address the shortcomings that stem from society and its current state. Our research will also be implemented in Finxerunt and serve as the basis for its campaigns, podcasts, and films; while the work Finxspire does is more so from a political standpoint, the work of Finxerunt will adhere more towards social change. All three organizations share a common goal in giving their best efforts to bring about positive change in the world.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraph">
          The ISL will be the first and largest of its kind. This spring, the ISL looks to accept over 120+ applicants and aim for a long term goal of 500. Through our work, we can bring these students and young adults various benefits ranging from volunteer hours to PVSA awards signed by the President of the United States themself. As many struggle from the implications of the global pandemic, the ISL will serve as an incentive for them to move forward and look towards a brighter future. 
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraph">
          The ISL serves as an important venue for the youth; the youth are highly capable and intelligent; many of them are cognizant or can identify if their societies are headed in the wrong direction. However, as it stands, it is difficult for the youth to have a say, for they are often overlooked and shadowed. The ISL looks to change that however. The ISL will allow for the youth to have their voices and ideas heard; through us, the youth can look to envision the very change they believe would be necessary to implement or consider. Part of the future of their respective societies starts with the youth, and the future starts with the ISL.        </p>
