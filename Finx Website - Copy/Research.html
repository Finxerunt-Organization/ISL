    <h3>The Socioeconomic Causes and Effects of the Gentrified Thrifting Experience</h3>
  <p>Thrifting is going shopping at a thrift store, garage sale, or flea market where one will find gently used items at discounted prices ("What Does It Mean To Go Thrifting?"). It is widely regarded as an environmentally sustainable way to buy clothing, as clothes in thrift stores are resale items. 
    Historically stigmatized as being for the poor, thrifting has recently changed in meaning and became a
     gentrified consumer practice done by many affluent consumers. </p> <a href="https://www.finxerunt.org/laboratory/the-socioeconomic-causes-and-effects-of-the-gentrified-thrifting-experience" style="color:black">Read More</a>

    <h3>Diversifying the American School System: The Evidence Paints a Clear Picture</h3>
  <p>The Eurocentric curriculum of the American school system has been a staple element in the education of its youth.
     For centuries, schools have incessantly utilized the teachings and themes of white savior narratives while consequently gaslighting the historical portrayals of people of color.</p> <a href="https://www.finxerunt.org/laboratory/diversifying-the-american-school-system-the-evidence-paints-a-clear-picture" style="color:black">Read More</a>

    <h3>American Democracy That Fails Us</h3>
  <p>America isn’t the democracy it promises to be. As Americans, our whole lives have been rooted around the
     idea that this country is the epitome of a true liberal democratic state that ensures the civil and personal rights of all.</p>

    <h3>A Cause and Effect analysis: Looking at the effects of lack of funding for schools on US students</h3>
  <p>The underfunding of schools in the United States (US) is a federal issue that affects schools and its students 
    vastly. It is a given that the importance of schools and the resources and education it provides, 
    through its funds, is a fundamental part of a student’s internal and external development. </p> <a href="https://www.finxerunt.org/laboratory/a-cause-and-effect-analysis-looking-at-the-effects-of-lack-of-funding-for-schools-on-us-students" style="color:black">Read More</a>

    <h3>A Cause and Effect Analysis: Looking at the effects of a lack of skill-based education in Schools</h3>
  <p>Skill-based learning is where a student learns a specific skill, so the student will be able to retain and apply the skill more effectively.

    <h3>Hurricane Maria’s Impact on Puerto Rico: How a Corrupt Government and Debt-Ridden Island Created the Perfect Storm for Disaster</h3>
  <p>The scenic island of Puerto Rico is beautiful from coast to coast. However, when one takes a deeper dive into her political climate,
     government, and the state of her people, it won't take very long to realize the potentially irreparable harm being done.</p> <a href="https://www.finxerunt.org/laboratory/blog-post-title-four-pya28" style="color:black">Read More</a>

    <h3>A True Democracy and Its Effect On America’s Social, Educational, and Economic Institution</h3>
  <p>The universal interpretation of a model democracy involves ideas that intend to promote equal voting rights for all, majority rule, and scrupulous elections. In fact, the very definition of a democracy is 
    “a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.”</p>
